# Cornell box
# http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~cwyman/classes/spring07-22C251/code/cornellBoxScene.txt
#
# This scene defines the standard "Cornell Box" with a few caveats.
# These caveats will be raised during the developments of the raytracer.
#
# Caveats:
#
# 	- 	The light color is defined in arbitrary RGB units rather than
# 		the physically measured spectrum described on the Cornell Box page.
#		(http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/box/data.html)
#
# 	-	The light is defined as a point instead of a quad with points
#
#	-	Materials are defined with RGB approximations to their spectral
#		reflectance, not the 4 nm sampled spectra on the web page.
#
#	-	The walls are defined as planes instead of meshes
#
# Notes:
#
#	-	The original Cornell box is rendered with a resolution ratio of 1:1.

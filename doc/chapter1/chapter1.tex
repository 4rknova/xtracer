\section{Ακτίνες πρώτου επιπεδου}

And now I begin my first chapter here ...

Here is an equation\footnote{the notation is explained in the nomenclature section :-)}:
\begin{eqnarray}
CIF: \hspace*{5mm}F_0^j(a) &=& \frac{1}{2\pi \iota} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{F_0^j(z)}{z - a} dz
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Σκίαση}
and here I write more ...\cite{texbook}

\subsection{Aνακλάσεις}
... and some more ...

Now I would like to cite the following: \cite{latex} and \cite{texbook}
%and \cite{Rud73}.

I would also like to include a picture ...

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \leavevmode
    \ifpdf
%      \includegraphics[height=6in]{aflow}
    \else
 %     \includegraphics[bb = 92 86 545 742, height=6in]{aflow}
    \fi
    \caption{Airfoil Picture}
    \label{FigAir}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

% above code has been macro-fied in Classes/MacroFile.tex file
%\InsertFig{\IncludeGraphicsH{aflow}{6in}{92 86 545 742}}{Airfoil Picture}{FigAir}

So as we have now labelled it we can reference it, like so (\ref{FigAir}) and it
is on Page \pageref{FigAir}. And as we can see, it is a very nice picture and we
can talk about it all we want and when we are tired we can move on to the next
chapter ...

I would also like to add an extra bookmark in acroread like so ...
\ifpdf
  \pdfbookmark[2]{bookmark text is here}{And this is what I want bookmarked}
\fi

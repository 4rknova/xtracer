About
-----
Xtracer is a basic raytracer written in c and c++. It served as my thesis project 
for the bsc of computer science in the university of Piraeus. It was developed under 
the supervision of Prof. T. Panayiotopoulos as part of the research work of the
Knowledge Engineering Lab (KEL).

The source code is distributed under the LGPL license.

Features
--------
Implemented
* Primitives    : Plane, Triangle, Sphere, Mesh
* Materials     : Lambert, Phong, Blinn-Phong
* Lights        : Point light
* Cameras       : Pinhole camera, Thin lense
* Drivers       : SDL, PPM, DUM
* Effects       : Reflection, Refraction, Depth of field
* Acceleration  : Threads 
* Anti-aliasing : Supersampling
* Other         : HDR, Gamma correction, Exposure correction

Planned
* Primitives   : Cone, Cylinder, Torus, Isosurface, N-gon
* Materials    : Texture mapping
* Effects      : Fresnel, Beer's law
* Acceleration : BVH, KD-Trees
* Drivers      : ASC
* GI           : Monte Carlo
* Other        : Animation system, Interactive mode, Adaptive 
				 exposure correction, Transformations, Phong shading

Notes
-----
* The scene is rendered in HDR. By default, the conversion to LDR is done with a sloppy 
  0.0 - 1.0 range cap. To correct the result, use the exposure switch.

* As far as meshes are concerned, only a bare minimal obj-compatible format is 
  supported for the time being. If you are using a 3d modeling editor you 
  MUST choose to only export the vertices and faces of the mesh.
  The face normals are calculated on the fly.

Compilation / Installation
--------------------------
The source code is distributed along with a makefile configuration script for unix based
systems with a GNU toolchain installed. To view all the available configuration options
type: ./configure --help. Once the configuration is done, you can build the binary by 
typing: make bin. To install the binary in your system type: make install. To uninstall 
type: make uninstall

Windows users should include all the files under ./src in their project and link with 
the dependencies stated below.

Dependencies
------------
* openmp	Must be supported by your compiler.
* libsdl    The program can be built without the sdl driver support.
			Type ./configure --help for more information on this.
* libnmath  https://github.com/4rknova/libnmath
			[ Last tested commit: df3b2ba6a993e3b66fff7e62b5ffa41f02c35514 ]
* libnparse https://github.com/4rknova/libnparse
			[ Last tested commit: d12984ffbab536f15d02b4ebe3d7cf2896c4fb7c ]

Supported platforms
-------------------
xtracer should be able to compile and run on any system equipped with openmp compatible
c and c++ compilers. It was tested without any problems under the following platforms:

* Linux
* FreeBSD
* MacOSX

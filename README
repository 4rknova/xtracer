About
-----
Xtracer is a basic raytracer written in c and c++. It served as my thesis project 
for the bsc of computer science in the university of Piraeus. It was developed under 
the supervision of Prof. T. Panayiotopoulos as part of the research work of the
Knowledge Engineering Lab (KEL).

The source code is distributed under the LGPL license.

Features
--------
Implemented
* Primitives    : Plane, Triangle, Sphere
* Materials     : Lambert, Phong, Blinn-Phong
* Lights        : Point light
* Cameras       : Pinhole camera
* Drivers       : SDL, PPM, DUM
* Effects       : Reflection, Refraction
* Acceleration  : Threads 
* Anti-aliasing : Supersampling
* Other         : Gamma correction

Planned
* Primitives   : Cone, Cylinder, Torus, Isosurface, N-gon, Mesh
* Materials    : Texture mapping
* Cameras      : Thin lense
* Effects      : Fresnel, Beer's law
* Acceleration : BHV, KD-Trees
* Drivers      : ASC
* GI           : Monte Carlo

Compilation / Installation
--------------------------
The source code is distributed along with a makefile configuration script for unix based
systems with a GNU toolchain installed. To view all the available configuration options
type: ./configure --help. Once the configuration is done, you can build the binary by 
typing: make bin. To install the binary in your system type: make install. To uninstall 
type: make uninstall

Windows users should include all the files under ./src in their project and link with 
the dependencies stated below.

Dependencies
------------
* openmp	
* libsdl    The program can be built without the sdl driver support. 
* libnmath  https://github.com/4rknova/libnmath
* libnparse https://github.com/4rknova/libnparse

About
-----
Xtracer is a basic raytracer written in c and c++. It served as my thesis project 
for the bsc of computer science in the university of Piraeus. It was developed under 
the supervision of Prof. T. Panayiotopoulos as part of the research work of the
Knowledge Engineering Lab (KEL).

The source code is distributed under the LGPL license.

Features
--------
* Primitives    : Plane, Triangle, Sphere, Mesh
* Materials     : Lambert, Phong, Blinn-Phong
* Lights        : Point light
* Cameras       : Pinhole camera, Thin lense
* Drivers       : SDL, PPM, DUM
* Effects       : Reflection, Refraction, Depth of field
* Acceleration  : Threads
* Anti-aliasing : Supersampling
* Shading       : Phong shading
* Rendering     : HDR
* Post-Proc.    : Gamma correction, Exposure correction

Notes
-----
* The scene is rendered in HDR. By default, the conversion to LDR is done with a sloppy 
  0.0 - 1.0 range cap. To correct the result, use the exposure switch.

* Only a bare minimal obj-compatible format is supported for the time being. If you are
  using a 3d modeling editor you MUST choose to export ONLY the vertices and faces of the
  mesh. The face normals are calculated on the fly.

Compilation / Installation
--------------------------
The source code is distributed along with a makefile configuration script for unix based
systems with a GNU toolchain installed. To view all the available configuration options
type: ./configure --help. Once the configuration is done, you can build the binary by 
typing: make bin. To install the binary in your system type: make install. To uninstall 
type: make uninstall

For windows users, a visual studio 2010 solution is available in the ide directory.

Dependencies
------------
* openmp	
  Must be supported by your compiler.

* libsdl
  The program can be built without the sdl driver support.
  If you are using the makefile type ./configure --help for more information on this.
  Different project files are provided in the visual studio solution.

Supported platforms
-------------------
xtracer should be able to compile and run on any system equipped with openmp compatible
c and c++ compilers. It has been tested without any problems under the following platforms:

* Linux           
* FreeBSD
* MacOSX
* MS Windows XP, 7

Mesh data
---------
Some scene files include mesh inputs that are not provided in the repository.
In order to render those scenes you have to provide your own meshes.

About
-----
Xtracer is a basic raytracer written in c and c++.	
It served as my thesis project for my bsc of computer science in university of Piraeus.
The source code is freely distributed under the LGPL license.

Features
--------
Implemented:
*	Primitives    : Plane, Triangle, Sphere
*	Materials     : Lambert, Phong, Blinn-Phong
*	Lights        : Point light
*	Cameras       : Pinhole camera
*	Drivers       : SDL, PPM, DUM
*	Effects       : Reflection
*	Acceleration  : -
*	Anti-aliasing : Supersampling
*	Other         : Gamma correction

Planned:
*	Primitives   : Cone, Cylinder, Torus, Isosurface, Mesh
*	Materials    : Texture mapping
*	Cameras      : Thin lense
*	Effects      : Refraction, Fresnel
*	Acceleration : BHV, KD-Trees

Dependencies
------------
*	libsdl    (The program can be built without the sdl driver support.)

About
-----
Xtracer is a basic raytracer written in c and c++. It served as my thesis project 
for my bsc of computer science in university of Piraeus. The source code is freely 
distributed under the LGPL license.

Features
--------
Implemented:
* Primitives    : Plane, Triangle, Sphere
* Materials     : Lambert, Phong, Blinn-Phong
* Lights        : Point light
* Cameras       : Pinhole camera
* Drivers       : SDL, PPM, DUM
* Effects       : Reflection
* Acceleration  : -
* Anti-aliasing : Supersampling
* Other         : Gamma correction

Planned:
* Primitives   : Cone, Cylinder, Torus, Isosurface, Mesh
* Materials    : Texture mapping
* Cameras      : Thin lense
* Effects      : Refraction, Fresnel
* Acceleration : BHV, KD-Trees

Dependencies
------------
* libsdl    (The program can be built without the sdl driver support.)
* libnmath  https://github.com/4rknova/libnmath
* libnparse https://github.com/4rknova/libnparse
